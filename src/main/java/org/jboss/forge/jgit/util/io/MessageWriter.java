 * This class is primarily meant for {@link BaseConnection} in contexts where a
 * standard error stream from a command execution, as well as messages from a
 * side-band channel, need to be combined together into a buffer to represent
 * the complete set of messages from a remote repository.
 * <p>
 * Writes made to the writer are re-encoded as UTF-8 and interleaved into the
 * buffer that {@link #getRawStream()} also writes to.

 * {@link #toString()} returns all written data, after converting it to a String
 * under the assumption of UTF-8 encoding.
 * <p>
 * Internally {@link RawParseUtils#decode(byte[])} is used by {@code toString()}
 * tries to work out a reasonably correct character set for the raw data.
